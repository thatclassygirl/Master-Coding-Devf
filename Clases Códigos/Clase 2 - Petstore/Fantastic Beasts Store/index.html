<h4>Hippogriff</h4>

<a href="https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Hippogriff#Behaviour" target="_blank">
<img src="http://pa1.narvii.com/6314/e567703d1c4a5fb4ab1739bf9e0244b866a6d27a_00.gif" alt="Hippogriff">
</a>

<h5><strong>Description</strong></h5>
<p>Hippogriffs were carnivorous and were extremely dangerous until tamed, which should only be attempted by a trained witch or wizard. 
    The diet of the Hippogriff consisted mainly of insects, birds, and small mammals such as ferrets. 
    They would sometimes paw at the ground for worms if no other food was readily available.</p>
<h5><strong>Behaviour</strong></h5>
<p>When Humans approach Hippogriffs, a proper etiquette must be maintained to avoid danger. 
    Hippogriffs were intensely proud creatures, and an individual must show proper respect by bowing to them, and waiting for them to bow in return before approaching. 
    Eye contact should be maintained at all times, without a single blink.</p>
<h5>Hippogriffs in the Wizarding World</h5>
<p>Using Hippogriffs for personal transportation is also illegal under the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy.</p>


<h4>Hungarian Horntail</h4>

<a href="https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Hungarian_Horntail" target="_blank">
<img src="http://pa1.narvii.com/7205/32611b30ba94b446d93931bcd8f4d2e9f1af5de9r1-268-268_00.gif" alt="Dragon">
</a>

<h5><strong>Description</strong></h5>
<p>Dragons are giant winged, fire-breathing reptilian beasts. 
    Widely regarded as terrifying yet awe-inspiring, they can be found all over the world and are frequently referred to in Asian and medieval European folklore.</p>
<h5><strong>Behaviour</strong></h5>
<p>Fireballs are unusual in that they are willing to share territory with one another, although no more than three dragons will share the same territory. 
    This indicates that dragons are highly territorial.
    Dragons are generally highly aggressive towards anything, even wizards, and will sometimes attack humans without provocation, such as in the case of the Ilfracombe Incident.</p>
<h5>Dragons in the Wizarding World</h5>
<p>The selling of dragon products is closely regulated by the Ministry of Magic, and only dragon species that are over-breeding are killed to make these items. 
    Those who study dragons are known as dragonologist.</p>


<h4>Phoenix</h4>

<a href="https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Phoenix" target="_blank">
<img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/11/1f/64/111f6463d0fc16a65a283942c715a88a.gif" alt="Phoenix">
</a>

<h5><strong>Description</strong></h5>
<p>The phoenix was a large swan-sized scarlet magical bird with red and gold plumage, along with a golden beak and talons, black eyes, and a tail as long as a peacock's. 
    Its scarlet feathers glowed faintly in darkness, while its golden tail feathers were hot to the touch.</p>
<h5><strong>Behaviour</strong></h5>
<p>Phoenixes are very difficult to domesticate, as Newton Scamander said in his book Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them: "The phoenix gains an XXXX rating not because it is aggressive, but because very few wizards have ever succeeded in domesticating it."
    There were two known domesticated phoenixes; one is Albus Dumbledore's pet phoenix Fawkes, and the other is Sparky, the team mascot for the New Zealand Quidditch team, the Moutohora Macaws.
    Phoenixes that had been domesticated were extremely loyal to their owners, and would depart to find their own paths if their owners died, rather than finding a new master.</h5>
<h5>Phoenixes in the Wizarding World</h5>
<p>Due to phoenixes being very difficult to tame and are one of the most detached creatures in the world, the wands with such feathers are the pickiest of owners. 
    The wands containing this core sometimes act on their own accord, due to having the most initiative of all core types. 
    Phoenix feathers are sometimes used as writing quills.</p>
